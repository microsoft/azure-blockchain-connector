# Blockchain Connector

This is a proxy for you to connect to the blockchain safely. We provide three ways for you to use it: 

    - Compile our source code (implement with golang) and run it.
    
    - Run it in Docker Container, with the Dockerfile we presented in this branch. 
    
    - Run with the binary release (not available yet).

## Run with the Source Code

1. Get the environment of golang ready.

2. 
```bash
go get github.com/Microsoft/azure-blockchain-connector/tree/basic_auth
```

3. In the project directory, run
```bash
go build -o <outputFile> HttpProxy.go
```

where \<outputFile\> is the name of the executable file you want to specify with, "HttpProxy" if not specified.

4. 
```bash
./<outputFile>  <parameters>
```
where \<parameters\> is the parameters needed by the program. To know about the parameters in detail, see the section "Parameters". 

## Run with the Dockerfile

1. Get the environment for Docker.

2. Clone or download this repo to anywhere you like (If you clone it, please make sure to check out to the brunch "basic_auth").

3. Run in the project directory
```bash
docker build -t <image_name> .
```
where \<image_name\> is the name of the output image.

4. 
```bash
docker run --net=host --name=<container_name> <image_name> <parameters>
```
where <container_name> is the name of the container you are to run, and \<parameters\> are the parameters of the entrypoint (which essentially are the parameters of the golang code). To know about the parameters in detail, see the section "Parameters".

## Parameters

1. parameters:

   - **username** *string*

            The username you want to login with (no default).

   - **password** *string*

            The password you want to login with (no default).

   - **local** *string*

            Local address to bind to (default "127.0.0.1:3100"). Note that local address can be non-local, But if so, you should make sure the connection from your computer to the "local address" is safe (e.g. the connection is in a LAN).

   - **remote** *string*

           The host you want to send to (no default).

2. example for users who run with our source code:

   ```bash
   ./<outputFile> -username user -password 12345 -remote https://microsoft.com/ -local 127.0.0.1:3100 
   ```

3. examples for users who run with Docker
    ```bash
   docker run --net=host --name=<container_name> <image_name> -username user -password 12345 -remote https://microsoft.com/ -local 127.0.0.1:3100 
   ```

4. If you want to use this connector to test your environment, but you only have a self-signed SSL certificate, the parameters below may help you:
  
   - **cert** *string*

            The CA cert of your self-signed certificate.

   - **insecure** *bool*

            Indicating if it should skip certificate verifications.
